Do you want to make a video call to your friend in Cambodia? In this case, you can use my program. 

# Server configure
I don't care how you will host my server on Flask, but I can recommend ngrok.
Here is the link: https://ngrok.com
To use ngrok you need to download flask_ngrok 
'''
pip install flask_ngrok
'''
Then uncomment lines 6 and 36 in flask_server.py and comment out line 35
____
Also you can use any other way to host

# Console configure
You also need to configure the python console. 
You need to open the properties and set the width 118 and height 40.
Good luck!
